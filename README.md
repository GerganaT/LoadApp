# LoadApp

For this project I have created an app to download a file from The Web by clicking on a custom-built button where:
 - width of the button gets animated from left to right;
 - text gets changed based on different states of the button;
 - circle gets be animated from 0 to 360 degrees

A notification will be sent once the download has completed. When the notification's "View status" button is clicked , the user lands on detail activity and the notification gets dismissed. In detail activity, the status of the download is displayed and animated via MotionLayout upon opening the activity.
